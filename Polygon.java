/*
CLASS: Polygon
DESCRIPTION: A polygon is a sequence of points in space defined by a set of
             such points, an offset, and a rotation. The offset is the
             distance between the origin and the center of the shape.
             The rotation is measured in degrees, 0-360.
USAGE: You are intended to instantiate this class with a set of points that
       forever defines its shape, and then modify it by repositioning and
       rotating that shape. In defining the shape, the relative positions
       of the points you provide are used, in other words: {(0,1),(1,1),(1,0)}
       is the same shape as {(9,10),(10,10),(10,9)}.
NOTE: You don't need to worry about the "magic math" details.
