- Asteroid have different shape (2 point)
- Break the asteroids into smaller asteroids when hit (5 point)
- Add explosion/death animations when asteroids are destroyed or the player's ship is hit (10 point)
- Life system (2 point) (Instead of teleport the ship back to spawn point, I make the ship slower after it collide with an asteroid, I dont really like the idea of resetting ship because it make like you drive a brand new ship, make the ship life doesnt really matter
- Generate new asteroids after a certain amount of time (use the javax.swing.Timer class) (5 point)
- Change the star movement so that they move opposite relative to the ship direction. (i.e. when the ship goes right, stars move left) (2 point)
